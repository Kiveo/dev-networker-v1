Rails will provide api routing for basic CRUD ops: (list, instance, new, create, update, delete)
  GET /api/contacts
  GET /api/contacts/:id
  POST /api/contacts/new
  PUT /api/contacts/:id
  DELETE /api/contacts/:id


The contact model should provide info, inclusive of:
  name
  company
  info

<!-- The user model should provide info, inclusive of:
  name -->
